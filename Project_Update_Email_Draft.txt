Subject: Project Update: QMS System - Key Features Implemented & Demo

Dear Manager,

I am writing to share an update on the Queue Management System (QMS) project. We have successfully implemented several critical features and improvements to both the backend and frontend.

Attached to this email, please find a **screen recording** demonstrating the end-to-end flow of the system.

### Key Highlights & Features Implemented:

**1. Booking & Ticket Logic (Backend/Frontend):**
*   **Resolved Data Issues**: Fixed backend stored procedures to ensure Token GUIDs and Numbers are correctly generated and returned, eliminating the "null" errors we were facing.
*   **Robust QR Generation**: The QR code now embeds a structured JSON payload (ID, Name, Purpose, etc.) ensuring it is valid and scannable by our verification tools.
*   **Database Optimization**: Implemented new stored procedures (`sp_CreateToken`, `sp_CallNextToken`) for efficient token lifecycle management.

**2. Premium User Interface (Frontend):**
*   **"Flight Ticket" Aesthetic**: Redesigned the ticket page to resemble a premium boarding pass, featuring a vintage beige card design, cutouts, and clear typography.
*   **Auto-PDF Generation**: Integrated `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`. As soon as a user books a ticket, the system automatically generates and downloads a high-quality PDF version of their ticket after 1.5 seconds.
*   **Dynamic UI**: The interface is fully responsive and adapts to user data instantly.

**3. Admin & Handler Operations:**
*   **Call Next Logic**: Added a "Call Next Token" feature for admins/handlers. This automatically selects the next pending token in the queue and marks it as "Called".
*   **Counter Assignment**: Admins can now select their operating counter (e.g., "Counter 1", "Reception"). When they call a token, it is automatically assigned to their specific counter.
*   **Real-time Dashboard**: The Admin Dashboard auto-refreshes to show the latest queue status, highlighting "Called" tokens in green and "Served" tokens in grey.

**4. Public Display Board:**
*   **Live Updates**: Created a public `/display` page that polls the server for real-time updates.
*   **Audio Announcements**: Implemented Text-to-Speech (TTS) that automatically announces, *"Token Number [X], please proceed to [Counter Name]"* whenever a new token is called.
*   **Visual Cues**: Added a pulsing animation to the "Now Serving" number to grab attention.

**5. Network Accessibility**:
*   Configured the system to run on the local network IP, allowing checking via mobile devices (phones/tablets) connected to the same Wi-Fi for real-world testing.

Please verify the attached video for a walkthrough of these features. Use the "Call Next" button on the Admin Dashboard to see the Display Page and Audio Announcement in action.
